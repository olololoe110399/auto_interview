    reasoningForScoring: The candidate provided a very brief response without specific
      details about their experience with Flutter or descriptions of projects completed.
      There is no basis to accurately judge their understanding of concepts, problem-solving
      skills, coding efficiency, code quality, knowledge depth, optimization skills,
      or the practical application of Flutter. Given the lack of information, scores
      for these aspects are set to 5, with the exception of communication skills which
      is rated lower due to the brevity and lack of informativeness in the response.
